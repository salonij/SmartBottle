# SmartBottle
Drinking more water can lead to clearer skin , better overall health, improved productivity and brain function , increased energy levels and even weight loss . 
A Smart Bottle is a reusable water bottle that can track your intake and alert you if you need to drink more to hit your daily hydration goals . 
This is especially usefully if you tend to forget to drink water throughout the day . 
A smart water bottle app is one that can integrate various data points to calculate the precise amount of fluids needed for a person to stay hydrated . 
Having the ability to visually see your progress for the day and how much more you have to drink to achieve your daily water intake goal is used to motivate you to keep drinking .
The smart water bottle will use some type of technology such as ultrasonic sensors or other liquid measuring sensors , to measure the amount of water in the bottle . 
As the person drinks water , measures are made and stored .
